It has been exactly on year since I lost all hearing in my left ear. A lot has happened.

I am not going to recount how I lost my hearing. I have written [two posts]() [about that already](). However, this post is about the first major milestone I am crossing now.

It is strange to wear a hearing aid. At time, it has receded to a placebo, of sorts. My doctor concurs, that the
hearing aid was a mere trial. She said that I will get used to having one ear, and she was right.

I am grateful to her, and I do not blame her for not being able to recover the ear. As I read more about SNHL, I realize how little it has been studied. I would like to personally share more.

It is not easy, sleeping on your one good ear and missing *all* the alarms. I wear *two* smart-bands now. Not to show off, but so that I don't miss notifications on my phones. I cannot tell where sound is coming from, not with any sort of accuracy, and I am not quite sure that will ever change. I have instead resigned to try and move my head so that the right ear points towards where I am trying to find something. It is a strange feeling.

I bought a Spotify premium account, after avoiding it forever. It, unlike Amazon Music, provides mono-channel sound, so I can listen to music in a single channel.

I have been reading about accessibility, and I want to improve the tools I build at work to integrate accessibility and usability into their design. I know organizations do not care for that, despite what they say. Instead, I would
still want to do this so that I can give back to the world that has given to me.

There is still so much to be thankful for. I have started using a treadmill, and I have been at it quite religiously. I am trying to form a strong habit, so I walk for 45 minutes a day after I wake up. I would like to increase the intensity and the duration for which I walk, but that will come in time.

I am reading more, and learning more. I was overborne with some insecurity these past few months. I have been very
insecure about my job and whether I would get fired for not performing a 110%. I have always been an over-performer, and anything below "excellent" seems to a poor self-rating. I have been working on accepting that I cannot be "excellent" always. Instead, I would like my work to meet expectations, while I use the time I have to better myself.

Two books that have proven useful to that end are:

1. Finite and Infinite Games by James Pearce
2. The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek
3. The Magic (**)

I also took a late night course on Racket and Scheme by David Beazley. He is one of my favourite conference speakers, and his talks are so informative. I am going to write a longer post on his courses once I manage to finish the others.

I have also been using my time to learn Rust. I **strongly believe** that Rust will be a language I want to code in. And I am already seeing how it affects the way I think about Python code.

But I digress. Back to my ear.

I would be lying to say that I am completely fine with having one ear. But like I have constantly believed and told myself, I have two choices: I can cry about it, or I can move on and find a way to live.

I choose the second.
