You have been seeing ads about kids learning how to `code`. Do you enroll for these services?

I have been wondering about this for quite some time. I am someone who has been tech-literate (*savvy*) for most of my life. I have had a privileged start, since my parents saved money to buy me a desktop in 2003. It was dad's hard-earned money, and owning it thoroughly led me learn more about computers and technology than school ever did.

In this post, I am going to outline my advice for bringing up a child *solely* with respect to educating them about technology.

## What is Technology Literacy

This is not a generic article on "every kid should learn to code". Instead, I am going to talk about *tech-literacy*. What I mean by this is the following:

You:
1. known how to use computers well.
   1. This includes making technology choices, such as getting a new laptop, mobile phone or tablet.
   2. Does not hanker after brands, choosing instead to assess technology well.
2. Can assess a new piece of technology well.
   1. If you come across a technological marvel in your field, you have the innate understand to assess its worth for you, and whether learning it will help you improve your standard of living or work quality.
   2. You choose to ignore buzzwords, fads and other pieces of technology that will come and go.
3. Can assess whether learning something new (technology/software related) might be good for you.
   1. One example is that a majority of developers shy away from Excel. They choose to ignore how powerful a tool spreadsheets are.
   2. You can also judge whether learning something in-depth in a particular domain is helpful for your career overall.

I know that my definition of this is not standard. Instead, I want to chart out a plan for a child who may be either home-schooled or taught computer-literacy outside of school.

## Roadmap

## Steps to Computer-Literacy

### Step 0: The Goal is to *not* enforce Programming as a Career

Anything you enforce to a child, or to a teenager, will be poison to their ears.
They will only mimic you as a preteen, so something you do for fun yourself will be fun for
them. Know that the goal is not a career in programming. The Python job you may have missed out
might not be relevant in 20 years. However just *enable* them to learn that computers are not
boring.

Do not:

1. Compare their progress to another child.
2. Tell them that this will give them a career. Kids won't care for it. Instead show them that computers can be fun.
3. Chide them telling them their ideas of being a tiktok/YouTube star are stupid. Instead:
   1. Teach them that these platforms might not be there in the future.
   2. If your child loves videogames, tell them that they can *make* videogames.
   3. If your child loves movies/cartoons, tell them how much computers are used in these fields.

### Step 1: Get them a **Desktop** Computer.

For their 9th birthday, get them a desktop computer.

Not a Laptop. Not your desktop "when you're not using it". Not your Surface Book or iMac or whatever. Get them a good-old desktop. If you know how, assemble one yourself, or get one from a local shop. Again, do not get them something
with store-provided service. Get them a CPU, a keyboard, a mouse and a monitor. *Let them own this machine*.

Again: *Let them own this machine*. They are the only ones who use it. They are the only ones who can fix it. If something happens, they use Google, or take it to a local repair guy (only the first time if necessary), and they figure out how to fix it.

*No, seriously*. This machine is theirs. It is like getting them a dog to teach them responsibility, but instead of you
taking them for walks, this machine is all theirs. They will do whatever with it. Teach them to get what they want for it.

### Step 2: Point them to Typing Tutorials. Let them learn 10 finger typing.

I have typed with two fingers most of my life. But in 2019, I spent 2 months teaching myself how to type with all my fingers. I was able to make the shift, thanks to a couple of resources and a few slow months when I was between jobs, and I am back to my normal speed of 70-80 WPM now. That doesn't matter, but what matters is that your child treats typing like a game. You are not going to make a coder out of someone who has to find the semi-colon key on their keyboard. Not easily at least.

There are plenty of typing games, I've linked to a couple here. Or they can install some typing software and learn how to do it. Give them incentives to type everyday. If they like to read, they can digitize their favourite book by typing everyday.

This will teach them to not fear the computer, and to become really good at a skill many of their peers take for granted. Plus, when they get to coding, they will not find the typing to be a pain.

### Step 3: Buy them a screwdriver kit

Let them learn to open the CPU. Encourage monthly/quarterly cleaning of the CPU case. Teach them that the CPU is something they need to clean. This will also teach them to not fear the computer. In doing so, they will also learn the parts of the CPU. This is good.


### Step 4: Get them a Raspberry Pi

For their 10th Birthday, or when they have opened their CPU Case atleast twice, whichever comes first, get them a Raspberry Pi.

Point them to good resources on it, here are a few links. This way they will learn how to get started with a Pi. Teach them that this tiny board is also a computer. Teach them that it has the same board as some mobile phones.

Let them learn how to move files from the Pi to their desktop without using a USB Drive or external hard disk. Wireless file transfer is only one solution. Let them discover ways of doing this.

### Step 5: The Scratch Programming Platform

No, Python shouldn't be your kid's first programming language. Not exactly. Instead, I recommend them learning scratch.
Around the same time they get their Raspberry Pi.

### Step 6: Python

This part is going to be a little different.
