I finally spoke at PyCon India! It was a great experience. I was a bit nervous
speaking as someone who had just lost an ear, but I am glad that the organizers
had arranged the "silent conference". The headphones supported mono-channels,
which is a blessing for someone who is single-sided deaf, like me.

Watch the video and feel free to ask me questions on twitter! I hope to write
more about Shelfie later.
