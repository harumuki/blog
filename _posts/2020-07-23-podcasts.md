I didn't listen to podcasts for a large part of my professional life. My friend Najeem introduced me to Talk Python, which was
the first podcast I have ever listened to and enjoyed. Since then, I have found a lot of podcasts that I follow, and wanted
to keep track of the episodes I love, as well as podcasts I love.
